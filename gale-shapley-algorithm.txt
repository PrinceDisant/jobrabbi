Variables: 
job seeker = js
potential employer = pe

algorithm stable_matching is
    Initialize js ∈ JS and pe ∈ PE to unemployed
    while ∃ unemployed job-seeker js who has a potential job/employer pe to apply to
        pe := first employer on js's list to whom js has not yet applied
        if ∃ some pair (js', pe) then
            if pe prefers js to js' then
                js' becomes unemployed
                (js, pe) become employed
            end if
        else
            (js, pe) become employed
        end if
    repeat
