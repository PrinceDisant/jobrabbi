## About Gale Shapley algorithm and how it solves the problem
The Gale-Shapley algorithm can be used to match job seekers with good soft skills to potential employers. In the first round, the algorithm matches job seekers with good soft skills to potential employers who have posted job openings that match their skills. In each subsequent round, the algorithm matches job seekers with good soft skills to potential employers who have posted job openings that match their skills and who are looking for employees with those skills. The algorithm is repeated until all job seekers with good soft skills have been matched to potential employers.
The Gale-Shapley algorithm is guaranteed to find a stable matching between job seekers and employers. In other words, there cannot be a situation in which a job seeker with good soft skills is matched to an employer who does not value those skills, and vice versa. This is because the algorithm takes into account both the preferences of the job seekers and the preferences of the employers.
The runtime complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of job seekers or employers.
In its most basic form, the stable matching problem takes as input an equal number of two types of participants (for example, n men and n women, or n medical students and n internships) and an ordering for each participant indicating their preference for whom to be matched to among the participants of the other type. A stable matching exists at all times, and the Gale-Shapley method solves the algorithmic challenge of finding one. A match is not stable if and only if the following conditions are met:
There is a first matched set element A that favours some given second matched set element B above the element to which A is already matched, and
B also prefers A to the element with which B is already associated.
In other words, a matching is stable if there is no pair (A, B) in which both participants prefer their matched mates to each other.
